{"name":"Se notifications","tagline":"A userscript that makes HTML5 notifications on new activity on a question open in a different tab","body":"### Welcome to SE Notifications\r\nThis userscript will make HTML5 notifications popup when *something* happens on a question that you have open in a different tab. This is useful for keeping track of events without having to keep going back to see whether a new comment has been added, or an edit has been made.\r\n\r\n### How to use\r\n- You need an access token. Get one [here](https://stackexchange.com/oauth/dialog?client_id=5174&scope=write_access&redirect_uri=http://shu8.github.io/SE_Notifications)\r\n- Install [Greasemonkey](http://www.greasespot.net/) (Firefox) or [Tampermonkey](http://tampermonkey.net/) (Chrome). These are userscript managers and allow the script to make use of `GM_*` functions, which it relies on to save your access token\r\n- Install the script: <kbd>[Install]()</kbd> or <kbd>[View source]()</kbd>\r\n\r\n### What events cause a notification?\r\n- A new comment will make a notification displaying the comment (uses the API to get the new comment, hence the access token requirement)\r\n- A new edit will notify you an edit has been made\r\n- A new answer will notify you it has been added\r\n- Accepts/unnaccepts will notify you the action has taken place\r\n- Score changes to any posts will notify you there has been a score change\r\n\r\n### Notes\r\n- Thanks to everybody's efforts at Meta.SE to document the Web Sockets that Stack Exchange uses. This userscript uses these sockets to find out if there has been a new event. Go upvote them [here](http://meta.stackexchange.com/q/218343/260841)!\r\n- Your browser needs too support Web Socket *and* HTML5 notifications for this to work\r\n- This userscript needs an access token because it uses the API to get the 'new comment' and display it to you in the notification; without an access token, you'd probably end up making too many calls and get blocked for a day!\r\n\r\n### Bugs & Feature-requests\r\nPlease post any bugs or feature requests at the GitHub rep, where I will watch and try my best to add the feature/fix the bug :)","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
